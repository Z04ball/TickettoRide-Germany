PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Project 5
VERSION or DATE: 4/29/18
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the 
main method of the driver
AUTHORS: Kaley, Ben, Tyler, Zach, Sean
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Run the program by running the main method of the driver class.
Input the players names and select each player's
colors. Click on start game to play the game.
The player must draw their destination cards by left clicking once
on the deck they wish to choose from and double left clicking the 
cards they want to choose. Click on the next player button to 
then proceed to the next players turn. After all players
select their destination cards they now can select 
their train cards by either left clicking on the card or left 
clicking on the deck to get a random card. When chosing a train 
card, the player is allowed to pick 1 rainbow, or 2 colored cards, 
or 2 cards off the deck no matter what cards
are picked.  If the user attempts to chose a color card, and 
then a rainbow card there will be an error popup.  If the user 
picks a rainbow card and then tries to chose a color card, an 
error will popup.  If a user tries to chose a second rainbow card, 
an error will popup. After selecting your cards 
click on the next player button to proceed. To capture a route
you click on the first city followed by the second city to get
the route between these 2 cities.  Then a panel pops up to select 
the cards that the player will use to create the route.
To select the cards you want to use, left click.  The top panel 
has the cards in the player's hand.  The bottom panel has the 
cards that the player has chosen to use for the route.  Then 
once finished picking the cards, click the x button at the
top right of the panel, and it will prompt the player to pick 
what color meeple the player wants to use. If you click on 
a city, and want to make a different move select any other city 
to bring up the card selection and exit from the panel.  
This will now allow you to make other moves or click other
cities.  Scoring is done as players are playing the game.  
At the end of the game, a screen will display, showing
what player won and what their score is. 
NOTES:
-Train upcards refresh instantly if a third one is coming up next.
-if you have more than 5 Destination cards, arrows will appear
to let you toggle through them.
-If you successfully complete a route, the card representing it
will be removed upon your next turn.
-scores do not update until your next turn, that includes meeple count.
-ignore all terminal output.
